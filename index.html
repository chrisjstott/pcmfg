    <h1>Services</h1>
    <b>Engineering and Estimating</b>
    <p>Beginning with customer blueprints and or design concepts, our experienced staff determines the most efficient way to machine each part. In addition, we assist each customer in finding unique solutions to their machining requirements. In every case, close attention to cost is always observed. </p>
    <b>Turning</b>
    <p>At the heart of our plant is the primary machining department which consists of 25 automatic screw machines with capacities through 5' 1/2" . Additional capability is found in the form of 8 Bullard Mult-Au-Matics whose 12" swing encompasses most engineering diameters. A variety of other equipment including CNC Lathes, Warner Swasey A.C's, Bore-Matic's and Fuji and Hardinge speed lathes complete the line up.</p>
    <b>Broaching</b>
    <p>Long a strength of the company, our Broaching Department is equipped with 12 machines and can work internally and externally to the limits of our 66" stroke, 15 ton machines. This means, "we can generally broach anything we can turn."</p>
    <b>Grinding</b>
    <p>Because most of our work is done to very close tolerances, our Grinding Department is very important to us. We are equipped to I.D., O.D. and Blanchard Grind to very close finish tolerances. </p>
    <b>Precision Assemblies</b>
    <p>This is where our plant's diverse capabilities are used to their best advantage -- in providing assemblies of finished precision parts. Also, for engineering or economic reasons, in-process components may be assembled and then machined to finish tolerances. In either case, by performing the work, "in-house", we provide "ready to use" components at very competitive prices.</p>
